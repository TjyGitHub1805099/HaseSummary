 * @ingroup lpit
 * @brief Low Power Interrupt Timer Peripheral Driver.
 *
 * ## Hardware background ##
 * Each LPIT timer channel can be configured to run in one of 4 modes:@n
 * <b>32-bit Periodic Counter</b>: In this mode the counter will load and then decrement down
 * to zero. It will then set the timer interrupt flag and assert the output pre-trigger.@n
 * <b>Dual 16-bit Periodic Counter</b>: In this mode, the counter will load and then the lower
 * 16-bits will decrement down to zero, which will assert the output pre-trigger. The
 * upper 16-bits will then decrement down to zero, which will negate the output pre-trigger and set the timer interrupt flag.@n
 * <b>32-bit Trigger Accumulator</b>: In this mode, the counter will load on the first trigger
 * rising edge and then decrement down to zero on each trigger rising edge. It will then
 * set the timer interrupt flag and assert the output pre-trigger.@n
 * <b>32-bit Trigger Input Capture</b>: In this mode, the counter will load with 0xFFFF_FFFF
 * and then decrement down to zero. If a trigger rising edge is detected, it will store the
 * inverse of the current counter value in the load value register, set the timer interrupt
 * flag and assert the output pre-trigger.@n
 * In these modes, the timer channel operation is further controlled by Trigger Control bits (TSOT, TSOI, TROT)
 * which control the load, reload, start and restart of the timer channels.
 *
 * ## Driver consideration ##
 * The Driver uses structures for configuration. Each structure contains members
 * that are specific to its respective functionality. There are \b lpit_user_config_t
 * and \b lpit_user_channel_config_t.
 *
 * ## Interrupt handling ##
 * Each LPIT timer channel has a corresponding interrupt handler. The LPIT Driver does not define interrupt handler internally.
 * These interrupt handler methods can be defined by the user application.
 * There are two ways to add an LPIT interrupt handler:
 *  1. Using the weak symbols defined by start-up code. if the methods
 *      <tt>LPIT<b>x</b>_Handler(void)</tt> (x denotes instance number) are not
 *      defined, the linker use a default ISR. An error will be generated if
 *      methods with the same name are defined multiple times. This method works
 *      regardless of the placement of the interrupt vector table (Flash or RAM).
 *  2. Using the Interrupt Manager's <tt>INT_SYS_InstallHandler()</tt> method. This can
 *      be used to dynamically change the ISR at run-time. This method works
 *      only if the interrupt vector table is located in RAM.
 *
 * ## Clocking configuration ##
 * The LPIT Driver does not handle clock setup (from PCC) configuration. This is handled by the Clock Manager. The driver assumes that clock
 * configurations have been made, so it is the user's responsibility to set up
 * clocking and pin configurations correctly.
 *
 * ## Basic operations ##
 * 1. Pre-Initialization information of LPIT module
 *   - Before using the LPIT driver, the protocol clock of the module must be configured by the application using PCC
 *     module.
 *   - Configures Trigger MUX Control (TRGMUX) if want to use external trigger for LPIT module.
 *   - Configures different peripherals if want to use them in LPIT interrupt routine.
 *   - Provides configuration data structure to LPIT initialization API.

 * 2. To initialize the LPIT module, just call the LPIT_DRV_Init() function with the user configuration data structure.
 *     This function configures LPIT module operation when MCU enters DEBUG and DOZE (Low power mode)
 *     modes and enables LPIT module. This function must be called firstly.@n
 *     In the following code, LPIT module is initialized to continue to run when MCU enters both Debug and DOZE modes.
  ~~~~~{.c}
 *     #define BOARD_LPIT_INSTANCE 0U
 *     /* LPIT module configuration stucture */
 *     lpit_user_config_t lpitconfig =
 *     {
 *         .enableRunInDebug = true,
 *         .enableRunInDoze  = true
 *     };
 *     /* Initializes the LPIT module. */
 *     LPIT_DRV_Init(BOARD_LPIT_INSTANCE, &lpitconfig);
  ~~~~~
 *
 * 3. After calling the LPIT_DRV_Init() function, call LPIT_DRV_InitChannel() function with user channel configuration
 *     structure to initialize timer channel.@n
 *     This function configures timer channel chaining, timer channel mode, timer channel period, interrupt generation,
 *     trigger source, trigger select, reload on trigger, stop on interrupt and start on trigger.
 *     In the following code, timer channel is initialized with the channel chaining is disabled, interrupt generation
 *     is enabled, operation mode is 32 bit periodic counter mode, trigger source is external, reload on trigger is
 *     disabled, stop on interrupt is disabled, start on trigger is disabled and timer period is 1 second. Note that: @n
 *     - Trigger select is not effective if trigger source is external.@n
 *     - Timer channel period must be suitable for operation mode.@n
 *     - The timer channel 0 can not be chained.
  ~~~~~{.c}
 *     /* Channel 0 configuration structure */
 *     lpit_user_channel_config_t chnlconfig =
 *     {
 *         .timerMode = LPIT_PERIODIC_COUNTER,
 *         .periodUnits = LPIT_PERIOD_UNITS_MICROSECONDS,
 *         .period = 1000000U,
 *         .triggerSource = LPIT_TRIGGER_SOURCE_INTERNAL,
 *         .triggerSelect = 1U,
 *         .enableReloadOnTrigger = false,
 *         .enableStopOnInterrupt = false,
 *         .enableStartOnTrigger = false,
 *         .chainChannel = false,
 *         .isInterruptEnabled = true
 *     };
 *     /* Initializes the channel 0 */
 *     LPIT_DRV_InitChannel(BOARD_LPIT_INSTANCE, 0, &chnlconfig);
  ~~~~~
 *
 * 4. To reconfigure timer channel period , just call LPIT_DRV_SetTimerPeriodByUs() or LPIT_DRV_SetTimerPeriodByCount()
 *     with corresponding new period.
 *     In the following code, the timer channel period is reconfigured with new period in count unit.
  ~~~~~{.c}
 *     /* Reconfigures timer channel period with new period of 10000 count*/
 *     LPIT_DRV_SetTimerPeriodByCount(BOARD_LPIT_INSTANCE, 0, 10000);
  ~~~~~
 *
 * 5. To start timer channel counting, just call LPIT_DRV_StartTimerChannels() with timer channels starting mask.
 *     In the following code, the timer channel 0 is started with the mask of 0x1U.
  ~~~~~{.c}
 *     /* Starts channel 0 counting*/
 *     LPIT_DRV_StartTimerChannels(BOARD_LPIT_INSTANCE, 0x1U);
  ~~~~~
 *
 * 6. To stop timer channel counting, just call LPIT_DRV_StopTimerChannels() with timer channels stopping mask.
 *     In the following code, the timer channel 0 is stopped with the mask of 0x1U.
  ~~~~~{.c}
 *     /* Stops channel 0 counting*/
 *     LPIT_DRV_StopTimerChannels(BOARD_LPIT_INSTANCE, 0x1U);
  ~~~~~
 *
 * 7. To disable LPIT module, just call LPIT_DRV_Deinit().
  ~~~~~{.c}
 *     /* Disables LPIT module*/
 *     LPIT_DRV_Deinit(BOARD_LPIT_INSTANCE);
  ~~~~~
