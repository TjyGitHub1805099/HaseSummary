@defgroup wdog Watchdog timer (WDOG)
@brief The S32 SDK provides Peripheral Driver for the Watchdog timer (WDOG) module of S32 SDK devices.@n
@details
 ## Hardware background ##

   The Watchdog Timer (WDOG) module is an independent timer that is available for
   system use. It provides a safety feature to ensure that software is executing as planned
   and that the CPU is not stuck in an infinite loop or executing unintended code. If the
   WDOG module is not serviced (refreshed) within a certain period, it resets the MCU.

   Features of the WDOG module include:
   - Configurable clock source inputs independent from the bus clock
   - Programmable timeout period
      - Programmable 16-bit timeout value
      - Optional fixed 256 clock prescaler when longer timeout periods are needed
   - Window mode option for the refresh mechanism
      - Programmable 16-bit window value
      - Provides robust check that program flow is faster than expected
      - Early refresh attempts trigger a reset
   - Optional timeout interrupt to allow post-processing diagnostics
      - Interrupt request to CPU with interrupt vector for an interrupt service routine
   (ISR)
      - Forced reset occurs 128 bus clocks after the interrupt vector fetch
   - Configuration bits are write-once-after-reset to ensure watchdog configuration cannot
   be mistakenly altered
   - Robust write sequence for unlocking write-once configuration bits

   ## How to use the WDOG driver in your application ##
   In order to be able to use the Watchdog in your application, the first thing to do is
   initializing it with the desired configuration. This is done by calling the <b>WDOG_DRV_Init</b>
   function. One of the arguments passed to this function is the configuration which will be
   used for the Watchdog, specified by the <b>wdog_user_config_t</b> structure.

   The <b>wdog_user_config_t</b> structure allows you to configure the following:
      - the clock source of the Watchdog;
	  - the prescaler (a fixed 256 pre-scaling of the Watchdog counter reference clock may be enabled);
	  - the operation modes in which the Watchdog is functional (by default, the Watchdog is not
	  functional in Debug mode, Wait mode or Stop mode);
	  - the timeout value to which the Watchdog counter is compared;
	  - the window mode option for the refresh mechanism (by default, the window mode is disabled,
	  but it may be enabled and a window value may be set);
	  - the Watchdog timeout interrupt (if enabled, after a reset-triggering event, the Watchdog
	  first generates an interrupt request; next, the Watchdog delays 128 bus clocks before forcing
	  a reset, to allow the interrupt service routine to perform tasks (like analyzing the stack
	  to debug code));
	  - the update mechanism (by default, the Watchdog reconfiguration is enabled, but updates can
	  be disabled)

   <b>Please note</b> that if the updates are disabled the Watchdog cannot be later modified without
   forcing a reset (this implies that further calls of the <b>WDOG_DRV_Init</b>, <b>WDOG_DRV_Deinit</b>
   or <b>WDOG_DRV_SetInt</b> functions will lead to a reset).

   As mentioned before, a timeout interrupt may be enabled by specifying it at the module initialization.
   The <b>WDOG_DRV_Init</b> only allows enabling/disabling the interrupt, and it does not set up the ISR
   to be used for the interrupt request. In order to set up a function to be called after a
   reset-triggering event (and also enable/disable the interrupt), the <b>WDOG_DRV_SetInt</b> function
   may be used. <b>Please note</b> that, due to the 128 bus clocks delay before the reset, a limited
   amount of job can be done in the ISR.


# Basic Operations of WDOG

1. To initialize WDOG, call WDOG_DRV_Init() with an user configuration structure.
   In the following code, WDOG is initialized with default settings.@n
~~~~~{.c}
   #define INST_WDOG1 (0U)

   wdog_user_config_t userConfigPtr = {
        .WDOG_LPO_CLOCK,           /* Use the LPO clock as source */
		.opMode = {                /* WDOG not functional in Wait/Debug/Stop mode */
		    false,
		    false,
		    false
	    },
		.true,                     /* Enable further updates of the WDOG configuration */
		.false,                    /* Timeout interrupt disabled */
        .false,                    /* Window mode disabled */
		.0U,                       /* Window value */
	    .0x400,                    /* Timeout value */
        .false                     /* Prescaler disabled */
   };

   /* Initialize WDOG module */
   WDOG_DRV_Init(INST_WDOG1, &userConfigPtr);
~~~~~

2. To get default configuration of WDOG module, just call the function WDOG_DRV_GetDefaultConfig(). Make sure that the operation
   before WDOG timeout executing.
~~~~~{.c}
   wdog_user_config_t userConfigPtr;

   /* Get default configuration of WDOG module */
   WDOG_DRV_GetDefaultConfig(&userConfigPtr);
~~~~~

3. To refresh WDOG counter of WDOG module, just call the function WDOG_DRV_Trigger(). Make sure that the operation
   before WDOG timeout executing.
~~~~~{.c}
   /* Refresh counter of WDOG counter */
   WDOG_DRV_Trigger(INST_WDOG1);
~~~~~

4. To de-initialize WDOG module, just call the function WDOG_DRV_Deinit(). Make sure that the operation
   before WDOG timeout executing.
~~~~~{.c}
   /* De-initialize WDOG module */
   WDOG_DRV_Deinit(INST_WDOG1);
~~~~~

   #### Example: ####
~~~~~{.c}
   #define INST_WDOG1 (0U)

   wdog_user_config_t userConfigPtr = {
        .WDOG_LPO_CLOCK,           /* Use the LPO clock as source */
		.opMode = {                /* WDOG not functional in Wait/Debug/Stop mode */
		    false,
		    false,
		    false
	    },
		.true,                     /* Enable further updates of the WDOG configuration */
		.false,                    /* Timeout interrupt disabled */
        .false,                    /* Window mode disabled */
		.0U,                       /* Window value */
	    .0x400,                    /* Timeout value */
        .false                     /* Prescaler disabled */
   };

   /* Initialize WDOG module */
   WDOG_DRV_Init(INST_WDOG1, &userConfigPtr);

   /* Enable the timeout interrupt and set the ISR */
   WDOG_DRV_SetInt(INST_WDOG1, true);

   while (1) {

	   /* Do something that takes between 0x100 and 0x400 clock cycles */

	   /* Refresh the counter */
	   WDOG_DRV_Trigger(INST_WDOG1);
   }

   /* De-initialize WDOG module */
   WDOG_DRV_Deinit(INST_WDOG1);
~~~~~
