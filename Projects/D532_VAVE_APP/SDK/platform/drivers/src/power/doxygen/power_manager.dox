@brief The S32 SDK Power Manager provides a set of API/services that enables applications
to configure and select among various operational and low power modes.

## Driver consideration ##

The Power Manager driver is developed on top of an appropriate hardware access layer (SMC, MC_ME etc).
The Power Manager provides API to handle the device power modes. It also supports
run-time switching between multiple power modes. Each power mode is described by
configuration structures with multiple power-related options. The Power Manager
provides a notification mechanism for registered callbacks and API for static and
dynamic callback registration.

The Driver uses structures for configuration. The actual format of the structure is
defined by the underlying device specific header file.
There is a power mode and a callback configuration structure. These structures may be generated using
Processor Expert. The user application can use the default for most settings, changing only what is necessary.

This driver provides functions for initializing power manager and changing the
power mode.

All methods that access the hardware layer will return an error code to signal
if the operation succeeded or failed. The values are defined by the
status_t enumeration, and the possible values include: success,
switch error, callback notification errors, wrong clock setup error.
