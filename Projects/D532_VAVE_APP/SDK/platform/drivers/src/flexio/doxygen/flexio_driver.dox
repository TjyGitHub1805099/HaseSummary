@brief Common services for FlexIO drivers
<p>
  The Flexio Common driver layer contains services used by all Flexio drivers. The need for this layer derives from
  the requirement to allow multiple Flexio drivers to run in parallel on the same device, to the extent that
  enough hardware resources (shifters and timers) are available.
</p>

  ## Functionality ##

<p>
  The Flexio Common driver layer provides functions for device initialization and reset.
  Before using any Flexio driver the device must first be initialized using function FLEXIO_DRV_InitDevice().
  Then any number of Flexio drivers can be initialized on the same device, to the extent that
  enough hardware resources (shifters and timers) are available. Driver initialization functions will return
  STATUS_ERROR if not enough resources are available for a new driver.
</p>

  ## Important Notes ##
<p>
  Calling any Flexio common function will destroy any driver that is active on that device. Normally
  these functions should be called only when there are no active driver instances on the device.
</p>
