@defgroup flexio Flexible I/O (FlexIO)
@details The FlexIO is a highly configurable module providing a wide range of functionality
including:
 - Emulation of a variety of serial communication protocols, such as SPI, I2C, I2S or UART,
 while requiring low CPU overhead and being more efficient that having multiple dedicated
 peripherals for each protocol.
 - Flexible 16-bit timers with support for a variety of trigger, reset, enable and disable
conditions
 - PWM/Waveform generation
<p>
Several drivers are provided for this device, implementing a variety of communication protocols. There
is also a common layer on which all the drivers are based, allowing more driver instances, either of the same
type or different types, to function in parallel on the same FlexIO device. Each driver instance needs a
certain number of FlexIO resources (shifters and timers) and as long as there are enough free resources
new driver instances can be initialized. The table below shows the driver types and the number of
resources needed by each one:
</p>
| Drivers | Timers | Shifters | Pins  |
| ------: | :----: | :------: | :---: |
| SPI     | 2      | 2        | 4     |
| I2C     | 2      | 2        | 2     |
| I2S     | 2      | 2        | 4     |
| UART    | 1      | 1        | 1     |
<p>
The number of timers and shifters available on a specific device can be found in the reference manual.
